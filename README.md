# **Weather App**

This is a simple and interactive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city by entering the city name. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the temperature, humidity, weather description, and a relevant weather icon.

**Key Features:**
- **Search Functionality**: Enter a city name to retrieve current weather data.
- **Weather Details**: Displays temperature (in Fahrenheit), humidity, weather description, and an emoji representing the weather condition.
- **Error Handling**: If the city name is invalid or the data cannot be fetched, a user-friendly error message is displayed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled to be visually appealing and responsive across different devices.

This project is perfect for those looking to understand how to integrate APIs with a front-end application and how to handle data fetching and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
